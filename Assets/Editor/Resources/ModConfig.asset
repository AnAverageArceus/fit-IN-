  description: 'Fitting In except I put too much effort into it and all the sounds
    are from TGM3 and I''m obsessed with TGM and also I love remakes of terrible mobile
    game ads

    Big thanks to obvi for helping with the generation algorithm

    Featuring a hidden grading system because this isn''t enough of a TGM-inspired
    mod'
